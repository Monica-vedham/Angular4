<<README - with instructions>>

Install git from git-scm.com. 
Create a new folder and in that create a file called as index.html.
Open an editor of your choice and in that open the index.html we created in the previous step.
Now open the cmd or git shell or git bash whichsoever you use to access the git and give the following comments in it.
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/Monica-vedham/Angular4.git
git push -u origin master

The command in the 10th line will add your file to your git repository.
